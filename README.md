### Project Descripton✍️

In this project, the Sketchpad application allows users to create common geometric shapes using a mouse or cursor.
In the Sketchpad application, we can create different shapes and diagrams.
Sketchpad application programm given below implments methods of the following interfaces to perform sketching operations -

1. Action listener
2. Window listener
3. Mouse listener
4. Mouse motion listener
5. Item listener

### Objectives✍️

- To draw various geometric shapes (Square, rectangle, circle)
- To fill different colours in geometric shapes.
- To make drawing with colours.
- To demonstrate how to build a GUI application using the AWT package.
